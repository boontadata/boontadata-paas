# how to edit diagrams

PPTX Diagrams are edited thru PowerPoint. From there, pictures are created.  

PPTX files may be uploaded to your free [onedrive](https://onedrive.com) where you can edit them and download the result.

If you happen to have PowerPoint on your desktop, you may also use it.
